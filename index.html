      <p>When I have time for leisure, I enjoy being outdoors hiking in the mountains enjoying nature.  Many years ago I had the opportunity to hike the Grand Canyon.  This was such an awesome experience that I will never forget.  Other outdoor adventures I enjoy include archery, ziplining, camping, snorkling and beach coming with my family.</p><br>
      <p>Another interest of mine is my joy of gardening.  A landscape designer assisted me with a landscape design.  For the past four years I have planted various evergreen and decidious trees and shrubs following this design.  Being out in my garden with a trowel and shovel, planting and getting my fingers dirty is hard work, but there is something about being in nature and hearing the birds chirping.  For me it's very therapeutic.</p><br>
      <p>I am very passionate about scrapbooking to capture memories of my family and friends.  During cold rainy weekends, I enjoy working on my scrapbooks.  </p>
